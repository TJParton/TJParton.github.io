    <h2 style="color:orange;">Early Life</h2>
    <p>As a baby I was always happy and smiling and was very chubby. Which is surprising due to the fact that I was born about 3 weeks early. Growing up I was       always the smallest in my class, which led the doctors to believe that I had a <b>low-growth hormone</b>. Although, I was smaller as a child I did not let that get in my way and used humor to make friends. When I was seven my parents decided that I should play a sport, and I decided to try wrestling. I believe that wrestling is a huge reason that I am the person I am today, even though I generally disliked the sport. I ended up wrestling for 9 years before I decided that I no longer wanted to continue pursuing it. Overall, I had a wonderful childhood fueled by a loving family, and have had many experiences and opportunities throughout my life that I am very thankful for.</p>
    <h2 style="color:orange;">Currently</h2>
    <p>As of now I am attending my first year at The University Of Missouri(Mizzou). At school I am pursuing a career in Cyber Security and am enjoying my time here thankful for the opportunities I have been given.</p>
